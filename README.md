Game Introduction
This is a 3d RPG game, can support multi-players.

The origin art and animation parts are from Marketplace of Unreal Engine. But all the blueprints and simple C++ parts done by myself. Considering of server, all the basic movement need to be adapted. Whatâ€™s more animation connection and construction also implemented from the very first in this project.

All the player movement, animation, interaction and AI enemies attacking can run well in local offline, server part and multi clients. In the video use options in play to simulate above situations.

This game contains basic PVP and PVE features, which also can work in server and remote clients), even though this game is not very completed. More improvement about this game waits for future development.
